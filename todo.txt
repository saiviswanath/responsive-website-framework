BUG:

Slideshow is dissappearing when I resize the browser!!!!



TODO:

Connect entire page to a javascript config to define padding or initial spacing issues.

Double check responsiveness

Create mobile menu

Sticky nav at top

Back to top sticky arrow at bottom

Form elements

Data grids

Folding data like FAQ or more info




DONE:

xxx Slideshow should be able to swipe in and out, not just fade
xxx Slideshow should be able to include Divs and not just images, so replace images with div
